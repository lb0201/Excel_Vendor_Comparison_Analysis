## Project Title

Excel Vendor Comparison Analysis

## Description

This Excel analytics project involves a comprehensive analysis of vendor discount rates, denominations, and sales data to make informed purchasing decisions and gain valuable insights. The project is divided into multiple tasks to achieve specific objectives:

### Tasks:
1. Denomination Type
In the "Vendor_2" tab, the Denomination_type column needs to be populated with either "FIXED" or "VARIABLE" based on the provided data.

2. Minimum Denomination
In both the "Vendor_1" and "Vendor_2" tabs, a new column named "Minimum_denomination" will be created to display the lowest purchasable denomination for each product.

3. Discount Rate Comparison
The "Q4 - Merged Brands" tab will be populated with data from both "Vendor_1" and "Vendor_2," including brand names and their respective discount rates. This tab will serve as a comparison tool for identifying the most competitive vendor to purchase from.

4. Best Vendor Identification
A new column titled "Best_vendor" will be added to the "Q4 - Merged Brands" tab. This column will indicate the preferred vendor for each brand, denoted as "Vendor_1," "Vendor_2," or "Same," based on the highest discount rate available.

5. Sales Data Review and Visualization
The "Sales" tab will be analyzed to answer critical questions, such as the most purchased brand and the top buyer among users. Additionally, one or two visualizations will be created to present key insights to the marketing team.
